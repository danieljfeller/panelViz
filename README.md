## Revised Protocol
15 minutes for training
5 minutes for Pre-Trial Criteria Elicitation
10 minutes + 5 minutes for each trial plus Health-ITUES survey
5-10 minutes for interview about the tools
	- should participants compare the tools?
	- what should our questions be? do we ask about specific features?

## Health-ITUES edits
1. Have to create another version for the patient registry
2. Have to provide instructions on how to answer (ie. 5-point LIkert scale)
3. Change language on items 12, 14, and 15 to be grammatically correct
4. Remove items 17-20 (‘User Control’).

## Data Dictionary edits
1. Data Dictionary and BOTH tools must have the same variable names. This was confusing even for me.

## Dataset edits
We need more virally unsuppressed patients in the dataset.
Ranking of inpatient visits and office visits may be wrong in both tools (esp. ])

## My Selected Priority Criteria
VLS
HCV
Office Visits
Drug Abuse
Unstable Housing
Schizophrenia
